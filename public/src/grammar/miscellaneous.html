			<span>
				<strong>Prepositions.</strong> Many Orcish prepositions are implied by the dative case. Prepositions are implied any time the case ending and context are enough to carry the syntax.  For example, if you asked an orc “Where is the dwarf’s head?”, he would likely reply <em>bennatho</em> (“the spear” [dative]) rather than <em>ix bennatho</em>, which technically translates into “on the spear.” As there was really only one preposition that takes the dative that could have fit those circumstances—other dative-taking prepositions (such as in, under, or above) wouldn’t have make sense—the implied preposition sufficed.
			</span>
			<span>
				Unimplied prepositions are typically used in more complicated sentences, such as those with more than one prepositional phrase, wherein an implied preposition would be confusing or vague.

			While most Orcish prepositions take the dative, prepositions denoting movement towards or pursuit—such as <em>zak</em> (to) and <em>akko</em> (toward)—take the accusative.

			<span>
				<strong>Comparatives and Superlatives.</strong> A comparative is an adjective or adverb that de-scribes a higher degree of a given quality (something more than something), but not the best. A superlative is an adjective or adverb that describes the highest degree of said quality (the most). Orcish has both formal and informal comparatives and superlatives, and both are used in equal measure by modern Orcish speakers. The formal uses suffixes to denote difference; the informal, prefixes.
			</span>

				The <em>–an</em> and <em>–ath</em> suffixes attach to the end of a word regardless of case.

				<strong>Gerunds.</strong> A gerund is a word that is derived from a verb, but that functions as a noun.  For example, the gerund of “swim” is “swimming,” and that of “run” is “running.” Gerunds decline as 2nd Declension neutral gender nouns.

		<p><span>
			<strong>Participles</strong>. A participle is a word that is derived from a verb, but that functions as an adjective (examples: the <em>fleeing</em> dwarf, the <em>avenging</em> orc). To create a participle, attach either the most common feminine <em>(–ad</em>) or masculine <em>(–ul</em>) ending to the end of the gerund of the same word. Participles decline normally and match the gender and case of whatever nouns they are modifying.

				Participles modifying neutral gender nouns take the masculine <em>–ul</em>.

	</div>

	<div id="numbers">
		<p>
			<span>
				<strong>Numbers.</strong> Orcish numbers have no gender and do not decline, with the notable exception of one (<em>nul</em>). When used as an adjective, one (<em>nuad, nul</em>) takes on the feminine or masculine gender based on the gender of the noun it’s qualifying. Neutral nouns use the masculine version (<em>nul</em>).
			</span>
			<span>
				Orcish breaks from the Syrronic alphabet only in numbers. Orcs use Archaian rather than Syrronic numerals because the Archaian numbers are quicker to write and take up less space. As with many aspects of the language, use of Syrronic numerals, while still entirely acceptable, is considered old fashioned; Syrronic numerals in Orcish are most commonly encountered in a formal or ceremonial capacity.

	<div id="sentence-structure">
		<p>
			<span>
				<strong>Sentence Structure.</strong> All Orcish sentences contain a subject, at least one verb, and often a direct or indirect object. Word order varies depending on the construction of a sentence.
			</span>
			<span class="sentence-structure">
				<em>Declaratives:</em> In a declarative sentence, the subject typically comes first, followed by the verb, any direct or indirect objects, and any prepositional phrases. In sentences with modal verbs, the modal verb appears after the subject, and the verb that it is helping goes to the end of the sentence and takes the infinitive. Any form of the verb “to be” (<em>aa</em>) usually comes at the end of the sentence. There is a fair degree of play in whether the verb comes after the subject or at the end of the sentence
			</span>
			<span class="sentence-structure">
				<em>Interrogatives</em>: In an interrogative sentence, the verb comes first, and then follows the same pattern as a declarative sentence. In interrogatives with modal verbs, the modal verb comes first, and the verb it is helping takes the infinitive at the end of the sentence.
			</span>
			<span class="sentence-structure">
				<em>Imperatives</em>: An imperative sentence begins with a non-modal verb in the imperative mood, and then follows the pattern of a declarative sentence.
			</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="ke">
		<p>
			<span>
				<strong>The Escalation Prefix (ke–).</strong> Orcish contains an interesting construction known as the escalation prefix. Attaching the prefix <em>ke–</em> to the head of a word indicates that the quality of the word is an order of magnitude higher than the unmodified version of the word.  It is most commonly used with verbs and adjectives and is an idiomatic construction that doesn’t always translate. Though a recent addition to the language, <em>ke–</em> is universally accepted as proper Orcish despite its roots in slang.
			</span>
			<span>
				For verbs, an imperfect translation is to treat <em>ke–</em> as “super,” “extra,” or “exceptionally.” A more accurate but certainly more vulgar interpretation of <em>ke–</em> for verbs is “<em>(verb)</em> the hell/ shit out of <em>(object)</em>.” For example:
			</span>
		</p>
		<div class="row">
			<ul class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-1 list-style-none">
				<li><em>Heldjart duwulz!</em></li>
				<li><em><strong>Ke</strong>heldjart duwulz!</em></li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="col-xs-7 list-style-none">
				<li>Maim the dwarf!</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Extra/exceptionally</strong> maim the dwarf!/
				</li>
				<li>Maim <strong>the shit out of</strong> the dwarf!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span>
				In some situations, <em>ke–</em> modified verbs have entered the lexicon as their own distinct words. One only needs to look at the related verbs “to kill” <em>(ka)</em> and “to slaughter” <em>(keka)</em> to see this in action.
			</span>
			<span>
				With adjectives, <em>ke–</em> most directly translates into “so,” in the sense of “ever so” or “to such a great extent.” This construction is poetic, and is often used to describe scenes of wonder or when recounting epic deeds. Orcish bards use it with some frequency.
			</span>
		</p>
		<div class="row">
			<ul class="col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-1 list-style-none">
				<li><em>Faerfidz kermitulz aggek.</em></li>
				<li>
					<em>Faerfidz <strong>ke</strong>kermitulz aggek.</em>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="col-xs-7 list-style-none">
				<li>The trees are green.</li>
				<li>The trees are <strong>so/ever so</strong> green</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p><span>
			While it is possible to use <em>ke–</em> with nouns, this is seldom done, and the orcs find such constructions humorous. While an outsider might think it a compliment to call a master Orcish ranger <em>(minsak)</em> a <em>keminsak</em>, the Orc would find the mental image this creates quite amusing. Exactly why orcs find <em>ke–</em> noun constructions funny is impossible to translate, though attempts reveal that such words make orcs think of a ridiculously hyperbolic version of the noun in question, often to the point that the noun ceases to be functional.  For example, a <em>ke–</em> sword would conjure the image of a barbed blade so massive it’s impossible to lift, let alone fight with; and a <em>ke–</em> bear would be a monster so huge, hairy, overly-muscled and bristling with teeth and claws that it can’t even move. When <em>ke–</em> nouns are occasionally encountered, it is usually in jest, or in a comical story or epic.
		</span></p>
	</div>

	<div id="gadz">
		<p><span>
			<strong>The Ubiquitous Negative <em>(gadz)</em>.</strong> One of the most frequently encountered Orcish adverbs and prefixes is <em>gadz</em>. As an adverb, <em>gadz</em> translates into “not”, and as a prefix it functions as “anti–” or “un–”. Indeed, many opposites are simply achieved by attaching <em>gadz</em> to the head of a word.
		</span></p>
		<div class="row">
			<p class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-1">
				Example 1:
			</p>
			<ul class="col-xs-4 list-style-none">

				<li>to behave</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="col-xs-5 list-style-none">
				<li><em><strong>gadz</strong>hialma</em></li>
				<li>to misbehave</li>

				<li><em><strong>gadz</strong>iterad</em></li>
				<li>chaos (literally “not/un– law”)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
			<span>
				Modified versions of <em>gadz</em> are peppered throughout the language, from the cardinal number <em>gudz</em> (zero) to the verb <em>gadza</em> (to stop, cease). The frequency of <em>gadz</em> and <em>gadz</em> derivatives leads to the correct assumption that orcs psychologically define the world negatively (by what something isn’t) instead of affirmatively (by what something is). Indeed, if one has ever known an orc, one will be familiar with their predeliction in communication towards disagreement, denial, and refusal. This does not mean orcs are pressimistic or inherently contentious, however. They are simply pragmatic and inexorably fatalistic, and the roots of this stem from the imprisonment under the mountains.
			</span>
			<span>
				The Orcish words <em>wua</em> (to enslave) and <em>wuarega</em> (to be enslaved) are both derived from the Middle Orcish verb <em>duworega</em>, “to be enslaved by dwarves,” the lot of orcdom before the Red Exodus. Yet hundreds of years after their liberation, the Orcish word for “freedom” remains <em>wugadzam</em>, literally “not enslavement.” This negative definition of freedom—what it isn’t (enslavement) rather than what it is (freedom)—hints at the orcs’ fatalism; in their worldview, freedom is the aberration, and enslavement the natural state of things. If anything, this negative definition of what most races take for granted helps explain the orcs’ fanatical defense of their own independence.
			</span>
			<span>
				A final thought on <em>gadz</em>: Orcish, like the orcs themselves, is quite practical. If you do not know the proper word for something, defining what you mean to say negatively through the use of <em>gadz</em> is likely to get the point across.
			</span>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="xenophobic">
		<p><span>
			<strong>Xenophobic Constructions.</strong> A unique feature of the Orcish language is the use of parallel adjectives and nouns to describe Orcish versus non-Orcish persons, activities, or qualities. Simply put, certain words that mean essentially the same thing are used to denote the race of the person in question. The most apparent example of this are the adjectives <em>ulad, –or</em> and <em>ulgadzam, –or</em>, both of which translate into “another,” and <em>ulork</em> versus <em>gadzork</em>, both meaning “other.”
		</span></p>

			<span>
				The ubiquitous negative gadz is present in most xenophobic constructions, and is the main indicator of race: the non-Orcish construction is usually sporting the <em>gadz</em> or <em>gadz</em> derivative.
			</span>
			<span>
				Accidental incorrect usage of a xenophobic construction, particularly when using the non-orc version to describe an orc, is highly offensive, but forgivable if done in ignorance.  Intentional incorrect usage of the same is a blistering insult, and one likely to be answered with violence.

	<div id="colloquial-prefixes">
		<p><span>
			<strong>Colloquial Prefixes.</strong> There are a number of common prefixes in Orcish that are either part of existing words, or that can be added to existing words to colloquially modify their meaning. Words created in the latter case are entirely informal and do not appear in this dictionary. However, given enough time and common usage, an informal prefix construction can migrate from the vernacular and enter the official lexicon; indeed, many have.

	<div id="adverb">
		<p><span>
			<strong>Creating an Adverb.</strong> There are two ways to turn virtually any Orcish adjective into an adverb, helpful tools for non-native speakers. The first is the suffix <em>–kit</em>, which roughly translates into “in a ________ fashion” or “with ________-like qualities.” The second is the prefix <em>shug–,</em> the quick and dirty equivalent of the <em>–ly</em> at the end of many English adverbs. Thus, the adjective “angry” <em>(zafrad, –ul)</em> can become the adverb “angrily” in either example:
		</span></p>
		<div class="row">
			<p class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-1">
				Example 1:
			</p>
			<p class="col-xs-2">

			<p class="col-xs-7">
				angrily
			</p>
		</div>
		<p><span>
			While either are acceptable and both constructions are commonly used, the <em>–kit</em> construction is considered more elegant and occurs with greater frequency in Orcish song and poetry. Words created with either construction are informal and do not appear in this dictionary.

			If the verb in question describes a disreputable or dishonorable action, the pejorative suffix <em>–dj</em> is used instead. This suffix is neutral and is used for either feminine or masculine agents.

				Note: What is a disreputable or dishonorable action varies from tribe to tribe and clan to clan. A culturally isolated tribe that lives primarily by raiding would likely refer to a “trader” as <em>bartadj</em> (<em>barta</em> = to trade), while a tribe where trade with other civilizations is an accepted and normal practice would use <em>bartag, –ak</em>.
			</span>
			<span>
				Additionally, some nouns that end in <em>–dj</em> that originally had pejorative connotations have since lost those overtones. For example, while a <em>krasadj</em> (baker) was originally viewed as a disreputable profession (stemming from when the only bakers orcs knew were non-orcs), its current ubiquitousness in Orcish culture has effectively rendered the pejorative <em>–dj</em> suffix meaningless.
