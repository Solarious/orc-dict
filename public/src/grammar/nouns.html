			All Orcish nouns have a gender: masculine, feminine, or neutral (neither masculine nor feminine). The Orcish language has no articles: no “the,” “a”, or “an.” A single noun such as <em>sharvul</em> (axe) can mean “axe,” “the axe,” or “an axe” depending on context.
		</span>
		<span>
			Orcish nouns have two basic parts: a root and an ending. The root conveys the meaning of the word, while the ending communicates the function of the noun in the sentence. The endings of nouns—and also the endings of adjectives and certain pronouns—are called <strong>cases</strong>. There are five cases in Orcish: the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative.
		</span>
		<span>
			All nouns in the dictionary are listed in their nominative forms. On the English side of the lexicon, nouns with both masculine and feminine forms are listed with the feminine nominative ending first, and the masculine nominative second. Adjectives on both sides of the dictionary are listed with the feminine nominative ending first, followed by the male ending.
		</span>
	</p>
	<ul class="decl-def-list">
		<li>
			<em>Nominative</em>: The nominative case indicates the subject of the verb.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Genitive</em>: This case designates possession or close association.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Dative</em>: The dative indicates an indirect object or recipient, and is often paired with a pronoun or implied pronoun.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Accusative</em>: This case denotes the object of a verb’s action, or the goal of motion.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Vocative</em>: The vocative is a case used when addressing a person or thing.
		</li>
	</ul>

		All Orcish adjectives must agree with the nouns they are modifying. They must match their nouns in both gender and case. Not declension, however—only gender and case; while there are five declensions of nouns, there are only two of adjectives. 1st Declension adjectives cover both 1st and 3rd Declension nouns, and 2nd Declension adjectives cover both 2nd Declension and either 4th or 5th Declension nouns, depending on gender (masculine or neutral).
	</span></p>

	<p id="1st">
		<span>
			Orcish nouns of the <strong>1st Declension</strong> are <strong>feminine</strong>. The most common ending for 1st De clension nouns in the nominative case is <em>–ad</em>, with alternate endings of <em>–am</em> and <em>–ag</em>, and, very rarely, <em>–aed</em>. The <em>–ad</em> (or an <em>–am</em> or <em>–ag</em>) is the easiest way to determine that a word is feminine, and of the 1st Declension. All other feminine cases have a single ending but for the accusative, which has a single alternate used in special situations: <em>–adz</em>, replacing the common feminine accusative <em>–az</em>.
		</span>
		<span>
			Note that this declension only covers feminine nouns of the 1st Declension. There is a second feminine declension—the 3rd Declension—the nouns of which follow an entirely different pattern; it is presented later in this section.

	<ol class="brackets">
		<li>
			For adjectives and nouns with both feminine and masculine forms, the ending <em>–ad</em> most commonly pairs with the masculine <em>–ul</em>, as do <em>–am</em> with <em>–or</em> and <em>–ag</em> with <em>–ak</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The alternate feminine accusative <em>–adz</em> is used for 1st Declension nouns whose nominative form ends in <em>–am</em>. Using <em>–adz</em> with an <em>–ad</em> ending word or <em>–az</em> with an <em>–am</em> word isn’t likely to make one misunderstood, but is the kind of missed nuance that identifies one as a non-native speaker.
		</li>

	<p id="2nd">
		<span>
			The <strong>2nd Declension</strong> of Orcish nouns covers both <strong>masculine</strong> and <strong>neutral</strong> gender nouns, which, in this declension, have many similarities. The most common ending for a masculine 2nd Declension noun in the nominative case is <em>–ul</em>, with alternate endings of <em>–or</em>, <em>–k</em>, and <em>–x</em>. The <em>–ul</em> (or the <em>–or</em>, <em>–k</em>, or <em>–x</em>) is the easiest way to determine whether a word is masculine, and of the 2nd Declension.
		</span>
		<span>
			The most common ending for a neutral 2nd Declension noun in the nominative case is <em>–id</em>, though the alternate endings <em>–ed</em> and <em>–d</em> are common. The neutral nominative also has the uncommon alternate endings of <em>–z</em> and <em>–dj</em>. The easiest way to determine if a word is neutral and of the 2nd Declension is to look for the <em>–id</em>, <em>–ed</em>, or <em>–d</em> ending.
		</span>
		<span>
			There are secondary declension patterns for both masculine and neutral nouns—the 4th and 5th Declensions, respectively—but they follow entirely different patterns; those declensions are presented later in this section.

	Notes:
	<ol class="brackets">
		<li>
			For adjectives and nouns with both feminine and masculine forms, the ending <em>–ul</em> most commonly pairs with the feminine <em>–ad</em>, as do <em>–or</em> with <em>–am</em> and <em>–ak</em> with <em>–ag</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			When the alternate masculine ending <em>–k</em> is preceded by a vowel, as in <em>shaggak</em> (slayer), the noun declines normally. However, when the <em>–k</em> alternate ending is preceded by a consonant, as in <em>mesk</em> (face), the entire word is treated as the root for the other cases. Therefore, the accusative of <em>mesk</em> is <em>meskudz</em> rather than <em>mudz</em> or <em>mesudz</em>, and the dative of <em>stakk</em> (leg) is <em>stakko</em> rather than <em>sto</em> or <em>stako</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The neutral ending <em>–dj</em> has a pejorative connotation. It is most often used for professions and individuals deemed immoral, weak, or undesirable in society. Words ending in <em>–dj</em> keep the ending when they decline as a mark of their shame; thus, the accusative form of <em>omvadj</em> (deserter) would be <em>omvadjudz</em> rather than <em>omvudz</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Using the <em>–dj</em> ending with a word that does not contain it—such as by referring to a warrior (<em>darrenul</em>) as a <em>darrenudj</em>—is gravely insulting.
		</li>

			The <strong>3rd Declension</strong> covers all <strong>feminine</strong> nouns not part of the 1st Declension. The most common ending for 3rd Declension nouns in the nominative case is <em>–ash</em>, with alternate endings of <em>–ard</em> and <em>–rd</em>. The <em>–ash</em> (or <em>–a[rd]</em>) is the easiest way to determine that a word is feminine, and of the 3rd Declension.

			The <strong>4th Declension</strong> of Orcish nouns covers the few <strong>masculine</strong> nouns not part of the 2nd Declension. Neutral nouns not part of the 2nd Declension are covered by the 5th Declension. Unlike with the other declensions, there is no single most common nominative ending for 4th Declension nouns; all three versions <em>(–b</em>, <em>–f</em>, <em>–p</em>) are equally likely to be encountered.

			The <strong>5th Declension</strong> covers all <strong>neutral</strong> nouns that do not follow the 2nd Declension.  Masculine nouns not part of the 2nd Declension are covered by the 4th Declension. The most common ending for 5th Declension nouns in the nominative case is <em>–ath</em>, with the alternate endings of <em>–at</em>. The <em>–ath</em> is the easiest way to determine whether a word is neutral, and of the 5th Declension.
