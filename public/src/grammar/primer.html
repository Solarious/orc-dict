	<h1 class="text-center">A Primer on the Orcish Language</h1>

	<p><span>
		<strong>I. History.</strong> Modern Orcish—throughout this book referred to simply as Orcish, as it is the most commonly encountered language among the orcs—is one of several Ordic languages, the most important of the others being Austral Orcish and Orkaanz, often called High Orcish or Ordic. Orcish in its modern form did not arise until well after the Red Exodus, when the orcs freed themselves from bondage in dwarfdom and spread rapidly across the Afterlands. While enslaved by the dwarves, the orcs spoke a transitional language that historians have named Middle Orcish, which bore the bridge between modern Orcish and Orkaanz, the original tongue of the Ord. Indeed, it was during the orcs’ captivity under the mountains that their language lost much of the floral speech and constructions of Orkaanz, shedding its articles and most pronouns and prepositions. It emerged from the dusky Underkingdoms much as the orcs did—an unadorned and efficient language for a blunt and decisive people.

		<span><strong>II. Alphabet.</strong> The current Orcish alphabet has its roots in ancient Syrron, the ecclesiastical city-state and center of learning that was the first to carve itself out of the chaos of the Old World. Though Syrron was eventually subsumed into the then burgeoning Archaian Empire, its alphabet survived, carried underground by the dwarves, who found it better suited to their language and easier to carve into stone than our modern Archaian alphabet. The orcs adopted the Syrronic alphabet during their age of captivity, as the dwarves forbade the use of the runic Ordic alphabet; as Orkaanz was one of the three arcane languages, it had the potential, in the hands of a master, to channel tremendous power even in written form. By making use of Orkaanz or the Ordic alphabet punishable by death, the Underkings both stole from the orcs the magical heritage of the Ord and sped the development of the modern Orcish tongue. The orcs of today—those who write, at least—use the Syrronic alphabet, as it was the only one they were allowed in their millennia beneath the peaks. Even to the orcs, Fartherall’s only direct descendants of the Ord, the knowledge of the Ordic runes is lost.</span>
	<span>In the modern era, the Orcish language consists of the following 28 letters: </span>
	</p>
	<p class="text-center">
		a b ch d e f g h i dj k l m n o p r s sh t th u v w x y z zs
	</p>
	<p>
		The letter y as a vowel is a relatively new addition to the language, and is used mainly by non-native speakers to indicate the short i sound, which is still rare in the language.
	</p>
	Notes:
	<ol class="brackets">
		<li>Orcish has no letter <em>c</em> other than as part of the <em>ch</em> sound.</li>
		<li>The Orcish <em>g</em> is always hard, as in <em>gain</em> or <em>grab</em>, and is never soft, as in <em>germ</em> or <em>giant</em>.</li>
		<li>The Orcish <em>j</em> sound is written as <em>dj</em>, and is the hard <em>j</em> of <em>edge</em> or <em>badge</em>. The difference between a <em>j</em> and the hard <em>dj</em> is subtle and hard to detect for non-native speakers or non-elves. The Orcish <em>dj</em> uses the Syrronic letter <em>j</em>, as Syrronic also does not have a native <em>dj</em> letter or sound. In keeping with the order of the Syrronic alphabet, Orcish words starting with the letter <em>dj</em> come between the <em>i</em> and <em>k</em> sections in the Orcish side of the lexicon rather than as part of the <em>d</em> section.</li>
		<li>Both <em>sh</em> and <em>th</em> have their own letters, as do the three letters that make up those pairs: <em>h</em>, <em>s</em>, and <em>t</em>. Orcish words beginning with the letters <em>sh</em> or <em>th</em> are listed in the Orcish-English section under <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> respectively.</li>
		<li>The <em>zs</em> sound in Orcish is pronounced as the <em>zu</em> in <em>azure</em> or the <em>j</em> in <em>dijon</em>. Its section follows <em>z</em>, and is the last letter in the alphabet.</li>
		<li>The letter <em>q</em>, which has its own section in the Orcish side of the dictionary, is written in the Syrronic alphabet as <em>kw</em>.</li>
		<li>The above letter order rules only apply in the book/pdf, and are ignored by this website due to implementation difficulties.</li>

		<strong>III. Pronunciation.</strong> Orcish as a language has managed to remain remarkably phonetic, a rare feat for any tongue spoken as long as it has been, and one which is all the more remarkable given the comparatively short lifespans of orcs. All single vowels in Orcish, with the notable exception of the recently added <em>y</em>, are long. The following is a list of the single Orcish vowels accompanied by a word in English with the same vowel sound.

		When two vowels in Orcish come together, they are often pronounced separately, as in the verb <em>boidla (bo-id-la)</em> and the noun <em>diendid (di-en-did)</em>. Certain Orcish vowel pairings join together to form a diphthong, the sound of two distinct vowels combined into one smooth syllable. The most commonly encountered Orcish diphthongs are:

		<strong>IV. Division of Syllables.</strong> As a general rule, a single syllable goes with the vowel that follows it, as in the noun <em>kalikam (ka-li-kam)</em>. Two consonants together or a double con- sonant are divided between the vowels of a word, as in the verb <em>shagga (shag-ga)</em> and the noun <em>sharvul (shar-vul)</em>. When three consonants are encountered together, they either fall into a 1+2 or a 2+1 configuration: <em>shafstam (shaf-stam)</em> is an example of 1+2, and <em>lordhul (lord-hul)</em> is an example of 2+1.
