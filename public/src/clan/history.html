		A Brief History of the Orcish Clans
	</h2>

	<p>
		The orcs are by no means a unified people. They are as varied in their customs and practices as any of the older races to the south. That said, there are commonalities that all orcs share, and familiarity with these is key if one is to fully understand the nuances of Orcish culture.
	</p>

	<p><strong>The Ord</strong></p>

	<p>
		<span>
			The orcs are descended from the Ord, a blue-skinned race of interdimensional explorers and technomancers who came to Fartherall when the world was young through great holes in the sky.
		</span>
		<span>
			The Ord quickly came into conflict with Fartherall’s other two elder races: the Ald (progenitors of the elves) and the Olom (progenitors of the dwarves, humans, and others).  When the war was over, the surviving Ord departed, but not not before the dwarves shot down a handful of their retreating airships.
		</span>
		<span>
			The dwarves carried the survivors under the mountains, where for generations they bred and warped them into optimal subterranean slaves. For a thousand years, this new race—the orcs—toiled beneath the whips of the Underkings.

	<p><strong>The Red Exodus</strong></p>

	<p>
		<span>
			Nearly 500 years ago, the orcs freed themselves from dwarfdom in the bloody Red Exodus, erupting to the surface in the sparsely-populated Afterlands. Sparsely-populated, but not empty; the escapees ran headlong into the handful of human kingdoms that had settled the region and found themselves caught between these human holdouts and the dwarvish army sent to recapture them.
		</span>
		<span>
			The way the orcs reacted in those first encounters with humankind formed many of the stereotypes that persist them to this day: that the orcs are a brutal and bloodthirsty people who live in perpetual savagery and barbarism. Among some clans, that’s true, just as it’s true that the orcs fought off the dwarves and wiped out human civilization in the Afterlands. Relations between the races have been strained ever since.

	</p>

	<p><strong>Physiology</strong></p>

	<p>
		<span>
			Of the sentient peoples of Fartherall, the orcs are the shortest-lived, averaging only half a human lifespan. They reach sexual maturity at eight, middle age by twenty, and are considered ancient at thirty. They breed rapidly, bearing litters of three to six young at a time, and their babies can run at the age of two weeks.
		</span>
		<span>
			Orcs are incredibly hardy and are merely uncomfortable in temperatures that would harm a human. They are green due to the chlorophyll in their skin. The dwarves bred this trait into them so they wouldn’t have to feed their slaves as much. The orcs receive enough supplementary energy through the process that they can thrive in an area much less arable than the human-dominated south.
		</span>
		<span>
			Another trait the dwarves bred into the orcs was the need to hibernate. Orcs must sleep at least two months during the winter or they begin to deteriorate mentally and physically.  One of the highest honors a clan can bestow (or harshest punishments, depending) is the title of “denwatcher:” orcs who stay awake, on guard, while the rest of the clan sleeps.

	</p>

	<p><strong>The Afterlands</strong></p>

	<p>
		<span>
			The Afterlands—so-called because the gods made them as an afterthought—is a section of the world about the size of Siberia, and about as densely populated. It ranges in climate from temperate in the south to arctic in the north, and contains every imaginable non-tropical terrain. It is a land rich resources, but stubbornly opposed to the plow; even at the height of the Archaian Empire, human agromancers couldn’t make farming the Afterlands worthwhile. It is a land ideal for the orcs, and there they have thrived.
