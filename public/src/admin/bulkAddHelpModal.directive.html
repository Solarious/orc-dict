			Words of these types have their conjugations/cases generated
			automatically
		</dd>
		<dt>Pronouns, Possessives, Demonstratives and Relatives</dt>
		<dd>
			Since words of these types cannot have their cases generated
			automatically, an error will occur if you try to add them using
			bulk add
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Instead please use the New Word function on the admin page
		</dd>
		<dt>Comma Separated Values CSV</dt>
		<dd>
			Each word is stored on a single line in the selected format. The
			available formats are:<br/>
			<code>"English","Orcish","Part of Speech"</code><br/>
			<code>"Orcish","Part Of Speech","English"</code>
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Quotes are optional if the value doesn't contain any commas, e.g.
			<code>kill,ka,verb</code> is valid, but<br/>
			<code>active,"sistrad, -ul",adjective</code> requires quotes around
			"sistrad, -ul" because it has a comma
		</dd>
		<dd>Most spreadsheet software can save their data in CSV format</dd>
		<dd>
			If you have a CSV file, you can drag the file onto the text area
			or manually copy and paste its content
		</dd>
		<dt>Tab Separated Values (TSV)</dt>
		<dd>
			Each word is stored on a single line with a tab character
			sepataring each value<br/>e.g.
			<code>
				<span class="tab-right">english</span>
				<span class="tab-right">orcish</span>
				<span>part of speech</span>
			</code>
		</dd>
		<dd>
			When you copy cells from excel or a similar spreadsheet software
			and paste them into the text area, the resulting text is in TSV
			format
		</dd>
		<dd>
			Since manually inserting tab characters is difficult, use CSV when
			manually inserting data, and only use TSV when copying directly
			from excel
		</dd>
		<dt>Don't add if already exists</dt>
		<dd>
			If a word with the same <em>Orcish</em> and <em>Part of Speech</em>
			already exists, it will not be added.
		</dd>
		<dt>Replace existing words</dt>
		<dd>
			All words with the same <em>Orcish</em> and <em>Part of Speech</em>
			as a word to be added is first removed. This will result in
			information such as <em>Extra Info</em> and <em>Related Words</em>
			being lost for the replaced words
		</dd>
		<dt>Allow duplication</dt>
		<dd>
			All words are added, regardless of if a word with the same
			<em>Orcish</em> and <em>Part of Speech</em> exists. Can result in
			unwanted duplication of words
